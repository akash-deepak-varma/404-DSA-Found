# 404-DSA-Found
# 🚀 ALL ABOUT DSA AND ALGORITHMS  

A **one-stop repository** for everything you need to master **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** – from **theory** to **implementation** to **problem-solving practice**.  

This repo is designed to help:
- 🎓 Students preparing for **placements** (FAANG, product-based, service-based companies)  
- 📚 Aspirants targeting **higher studies** (GATE, GRE, competitive exams)  
- 🏆 Competitive programmers who want **fast recall** of concepts
